		<h2><u>ABOUT US</u></h2>
		<p>Saurabh Vaidya and Maaz Adhoni are two students pursuing their MSC in Computer Science at MIT World Peace University, Pune. They are passionate about teaching coding to students and have embarked on a project to build an e-learning platform that teaches Python language in a fun and interactive way.

			The purpose behind this project is to make learning coding simple and enjoyable for students. Saurabh and Maaz understand that coding can be daunting for beginners and want to make the learning process more accessible. Their platform includes simple games that allow students to learn Python language in a fun and engaging way.
			
			Through their platform, Saurabh and Maaz hope to inspire more students to take an interest in coding and pursue careers in computer science. Their project is a testament to their dedication to helping students learn and achieve their goals.</p>
